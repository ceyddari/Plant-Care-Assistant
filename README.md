# Plant Care Assistant

This is a small Java project developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Project Overview

Plant Care Assistant is a simple application that helps manage care tasks for plants such as watering and fertilizing. It demonstrates basic OOP principles through real-world modeling.

The application includes:
- Creation of different plant types with specific care requirements
- Scheduling of care tasks based on last care dates
- Notification logic via email or SMS simulation
- Automatic updating of care status

## Technologies

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation

## Project Structure

- `Plant.java` – Base class for plants
- `Cactus.java`, `Orchid.java` – Subclasses with specific implementations
- `CareScheduler.java` – Generates care reminders
- `Reminder.java` – Represents scheduled care tasks
- `NotificationStrategy` – Strategy pattern for sending notifications
- `Main.java` – Entry point to run the application

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on example of OOP in Java, making it suitable for beginners who want to reinforce their understanding of class hierarchies, design patterns, and encapsulation.
